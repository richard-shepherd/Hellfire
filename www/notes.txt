TO-DOs in order
---------------






- Waypoint manager
  - This knows if waypoints have been selected.
  - It shows the map and stores the waypoints.


- Store coordinates of all objects as (x, y) meters from an origin
  - x: west-east (-ve=west, +ve=east)
  - y: north-south (-ve=south, +ve=north)

- The origin is the first reported position from the GPS
  - When we get this we also work out the m/deg-lat and m/deg-long

- We need a startup class and splash-screen
  - We pre-load a bunch of things, such as images, textures, sounds
  - The splash screen should show this.
  - Only when everything is loaded do we move to the main game screen.

- In the game loop, the first thing we do is to convert the current
  position to an (x, y) in meters.

- We convert all game-item positions to polar coordinates to show on the radar

- We convert all game-item positoins to lat/long to show on the map

- We have a tab which shows a map
  - It shows your current position - as a pentagram?
  - It shows the position of the next waypoint as a map marker
  - It shows monsters, players, weapons, armour and ammo
  - You can shrink or zoom the map.
  - You can set the waypoints
    - Initial game is: get to waypoint and back again. Fighting monsters.

- Ammo, weapons, armour could have a limited life
  - So you have to run to them
  - The time could be configurable
  - The time would be shown on the map and on the radar.

- Do you need the video in the single-player game?
  - A: No. But it might be good anyway!
