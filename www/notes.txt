TO-DOs in order
---------------





Shooting
--------
- You shoot using the current weapon
  - Is this e.g. a GameItem_Shotgun?
    - Let's say NO
      - Because GameItems are things in the world
      - They are shown as sprites and on the radar
    - Let's say YES:
      - They could not be shown on the radar
      - They could have a "heldByPlayer" flag and not show in that case

- What happens when Fire is pressed?
  - A: It depends on the weapon.
    - Some take effect immediately (e.g. shotgun)
    - Others fire slower, e.g. rocket launcher

- Got to have a chainsaw!!!
  - You need to move it up and down for it to work.





Moving game items
-----------------
- Some items move by themselves
  - Monsters
  - Rockets
  - Fireballs

- updatePosition(timeDelta)
  - Updates the position based on the time elapsed since the previous update



Splash screen and loaders
-------------------------
- Some should be optional
  - In particular, the GPS accuracy
  - We can show a "Skip" button once all the non-optional
    items have completed.




GameItem_Monster base class?
----------------------------
- Then GameItem_Monster_Imp etc.
- Is there any need for the base class?
- Maybe just make GameItem_Imp to begin with


Adding items
------------
- Items randomly appear
  - Monsters
  - Ammo
  - Armour

- They appear at random intervals

- Ammo, weapons, armour could have a limited life
  - So you have to run to them
  - The time could be configurable
  - The time would be shown on the map and on the radar.
