TO-DOs in order
---------------







Moving game items
-----------------
- Some items move by themselves
  - Monsters
  - Rockets
  - Fireballs

- updatePosition(timeDelta)
  - Updates the position based on the time elapsed since the previous update




GameItem_Monster base class?
----------------------------
- Then GameItem_Monster_Imp etc.
- Is there any need for the base class?
- Maybe just make GameItem_Imp to begin with


Game area
---------
- We need a concept of the game area
- A rectangle bounded by the waypoints
  - Plus a margin


Adding items
------------
- Items randomly appear
  - Monsters
  - Ammo
  - Armour

- They appear at random intervals

- At the start of the game, we create a number of items

- Items should be created in the "game area"


- We need a startup class and splash-screen
  - We pre-load a bunch of things, such as images, textures, sounds
  - The splash screen should show this.
  - Only when everything is loaded do we move to the main game screen.

- Ammo, weapons, armour could have a limited life
  - So you have to run to them
  - The time could be configurable
  - The time would be shown on the map and on the radar.

- Do you need the video in the single-player game?
  - A: No. But it might be good anyway!
